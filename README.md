# **Thera Bank Personal Loan Campaign Analysis**

---

---

## **Project Overview**

Thera Bank recently achieved a 9.6% conversion rate in its personal loan campaign. While commendable, this provides an opportunity to optimize targeting and increase campaign efficiency. This project focuses on developing a **predictive model** that identifies liability customers likely to accept personal loans, enabling **targeted marketing efforts** that reduce costs and maximize conversions.

---

## **Objectives**

1. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a liability customer accepting a personal loan.
2. **Targeted Campaigns**: Identify high-potential customers for future campaigns, ensuring better resource utilization.
3. **Data Insights**: Provide actionable insights into customer behavior and their relationship with the bank.

## **Deliverables**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Summary statistics and data visualizations.
   - Insights into target variable correlations.
   - Identification of high-impact predictors.
2. **Model Development**:

   - Trained classification models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naïve Bayes.
   - Feature importance analysis and performance evaluation.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
